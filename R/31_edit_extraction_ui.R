# beside it (`extraction_outline_ui()`). The header's buttons: Undo, Save, Open PDF (if the file is here: it
# opens in its own tab, at the page of the block picked), Re-extract (an AI-Powered draft read again with the latest prompt:
# `reextract_dialog()`) and Preview and push (where it goes, what pushing adds, and the push itself:
# `push_dialog()`).
# On a phone the buttons are only their icons, sharing a row of their own evenly under the progress bar.
# (It was called the review page.)
