# ------ The same question about each of several people ----------------------------------------------
# Some forms ask the same questions about one person and then again about another: MQ has a section about
# twin A, then the same section about twin B. They are one question each, with a variable for each person.
# The reading words them alike and tags each question with its one person (the prompt's "The same questions
# about each of several people"); `draft_service_join_repeats()` then joins them, when the AI's answer is
# opened (`draft_service_from_json()`). The copy staff save is never joined: it is as they left it.
#
# Two questions are the same when their words are (and their grid's lead-in's, for a grid's items), give or take
# capitals, punctuation and whether a word is written for one person or several (`same_words()`), and each is
# about one person, a different one. The two copies are read in separate requests, and Gemini doesn't always
# inflect or punctuate them alike ("acts like" and "act like", "the twins' life" and "lives", 'butt in' and
# "butt in"); the joined question keeps the first copy's words. Anything else is left as it was read, so nothing
# is joined on a guess: when the AI words two of them differently, they stay two questions and staff join them
# by hand, as before.

# What a question is told by: its words as they are compared (`same_words()`), after its grid's lead-in if it is
# in a grid. A follow-up ("If yes, why?") is told by the question it depends on instead of where it sits, since
# one reading may put it in the grid and another after it.
# Returns: A character vector, one for each row of `blocks`.
