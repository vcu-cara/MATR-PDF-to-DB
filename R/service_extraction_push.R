# ------ Pushing an extraction into the database --------------------------------------------
# An extraction becomes rows of the MATR metadata database, in a recorded questionnaire's wave that
# asks no questions yet: its blocks as components placed in the questionnaire, its questions and
# their numbers in the wave, each question's variables with their choices, and the subjects, time
# frames and units as tags. The database does all of it in one function, push_extraction()
# (sql/4_functions.sql), from the questionnaire as saved and its Basic Info (`info`): what is there
# already (a wording, an answer choice, a tag, a placement of an earlier wave, a variable with the
# same MATR ID) is used again, the rest is added, and the extraction is marked Pushed. The function
# answers with counts of what it did (`component_new`, `component_reused`, `placement_new`,
# `wave_question_new`, `variable_new`, `variable_reused`, `answer_option_new`, `tag_new`... and
# `questions`), and refuses with a sentence when it can't: a wave that asks questions already
# (Empty it first on the Metadata page), no questions, Basic Info missing.
#
# The push is previewed and done on the Edit Extraction page. The preview is the same function told
# only to try (`p_dry_run`): it does everything and undoes it, and the counts come back, so what the
# page shows is exactly what the push will do.
