# Reading a questionnaire for the MATR metadata database

You are reading a printed questionnaire from the Mid-Atlantic Twin Registry (MATR) for a catalog of every question the registry has asked. Researchers search the catalog to find what was asked, about whom and about when, across fifty years of questionnaires; when they want a question's exact printed words they open the PDF, which the catalog links. So your record is not a transcript of the page. It says **what was asked**, in plain words that are the same wherever the same thing is asked, as JSON in the shape described below.

Three rules hold throughout:

- **Never invent.** Record only the questions, answer choices and facts that are printed. Never add a question, a choice (the one exception is the "No" of a check-all-that-apply box: see "Choices"), a number or a meaning the page doesn't have.
- **Normalize the wording.** Every question is one complete, plain sentence (see "Wording"), and when it asks about is recorded as a tag (`time_frame`), not as words. Two questionnaires that ask the same thing should give the same `text`.
- **Each thing once.** Every printed question is recorded once, on the pages it is printed on. Nothing is recorded twice, and nothing is said in two places (a time in the words and again as a tag; a caption as a label and again as a unit).

Capitals don't matter: the site keeps every word in lower case.

## The JSON

Answer with one JSON object and nothing else: no prose, no markdown fences, no explanation. Write it compactly, without indentation or line breaks. These are the only fields, each object's in the order listed:

- the questionnaire: `questionnaire` (an object with `name` and `abbreviation`), then `components` (a list of blocks)
- a block: `component_type`, `continued`, `text`, `printed_number`, `parent_question`, `time_frame`, `variables` (a list of variables), `children` (a list of blocks)
- a variable: `variable_type`, `label`, `subject`, `time_frame`, `answer_data_type`, `unit`, `response_options` (a list of choices)
- a choice: `answer_option`

`continued` is true or false; every other field holds text. Leave out any field that would be empty: never write null, "" or [] for a field, and never fill one in to be helpful when nothing is printed for it.

## Leave out

- Anything covered by a redaction (a solid black box), even partly. If a question, a table column or an answer box is partly hidden, leave all of it out rather than guess. Don't mention the redaction.
- Blanks that collect who someone is rather than asking about them: names, street addresses, telephone numbers and dates of birth, including the name, address and birthdate columns of a table about the respondent's children or brothers and sisters. Keep that table's other columns, such as sex, relationship or whether they live with the respondent, even when they are all that's left of it (one Question per column, as in "Layouts" below), and keep every number a question asks for, such as an age or a count.
- Marks made on the form after it was printed: handwriting, ticks, crosses, circled or filled-in answers, staff notes and codes in the margins. Record the blank form.
- Page headers and footers, page numbers, form codes, office-use-only boxes, ID or barcode fields, and closing courtesies such as "Thank you for your time."
- The date the form is filled in ("Today's date", "Please provide today's date"), with any heading that holds nothing else.
- **Directions on how to mark or give an answer**: "Mark one.", "Fill in the appropriate oval for each statement.", "Circle one number.", "Check all that apply.", "Please answer each question by marking Yes or No.", "Please give an answer for "a" - "d".", "Write in a number.", "Please fill in only one oval.". They say nothing about what is asked, so they are not recorded anywhere: not as a block, and not in a question's `text`. (A check-all-that-apply direction still decides how the boxes are recorded: see "Choices".)
- **Sentences that only announce or bridge**: "The next questions ask about your health.", "This section contains questions only about Twin A.", "These questions refer to what you usually do in regard to consuming alcohol (beer, wine, wine coolers, and liquor).", "Look back to the address page if you need to remind yourself which twin is Twin A.", "This is the final section.", "Now we would like to ask about your friends.". The questions say it already.
- **Sentences that only explain a table's columns or boxes**: which column is for whom, or who a column's people are ("Indicate whether any immediate family member (a parent or biological brother, sister, or child) has ever had each condition.", "Answer for both living and deceased biological relatives including your twin, grandparents, parents, …"). The Grid's lead-in and its variables say it (see "Layouts", pattern 2).
- **Words that point at another part of the form**: "listed in question 41", "that is not listed on this page", "(see above)", "on the next page". Say the thing itself in plain words instead, or leave the words out: "How many separate times have you experienced many of the symptoms listed in question 41 for two weeks or more?" is "How many separate times have you experienced these symptoms for two weeks or more?"; "What serious medical or health problem have you had that is not listed on this page?" is "What serious medical or health problem have you had?".
- Routing ("Go to Question 9"): see "Routing".

What is kept of the text around the questions is only what changes what an answer means: what to count, which situation to answer for, who answers, what a term means (see **Instruction** and **Definition** under "Blocks").

## Wording

How every `text` is written.

1. **A complete sentence.** A Question's `text` is a whole question or statement a researcher understands on its own. A question printed only as a label for its answer is written as the question it stands for, about whoever the answer is about: "Height?" or a box captioned "Height" is "What is your height?"; "Sex" is "What is your sex?"; "Date of birth" is "What is your date of birth?"; a table's column heading "Child's Sex", "Sex" or "Gender" is "What is your child's sex?" (always "sex", never "gender"); "Birth weight" is "What is your child's birth weight?"; "Currently living with you?" is "Is your child currently living with you?". Add only the words that make it a question, in the present tense unless the heading is in the past, and keep the heading's own words as printed: "Length of pregnancy" is "What was the length of pregnancy?"; a heading that is a question already keeps its words ("Did you smoke during pregnancy?"). An item printed short, leaning on the one before it, is written whole: "Sisters?" after "How many brothers do you have?" is "How many sisters do you have?". A direction that is itself the question is written as the question: "Mark all the places you have lived." is "In which places have you lived?"; "Please indicate in the boxes how many years of schooling you have completed (00-25):" is "How many years of schooling have you completed?". A statement respondents rate ("I felt shaky or jittery.", "My child smiles often.") is whole already. The only texts that aren't whole on their own are a Grid's lead-in and its items, which make one whole sentence together (see "Layouts"), and a stem that the answer choices finish ("My health is", "When the pain was at its worst, it lasted").
2. **Without the time it asks about.** When the words name a time, record it as the `time_frame` (see "Tags") and leave it out of the words, so the same question about another time is the same `text`:
   - A span of time is left out: "During the past 30 days about how many cigarettes have you smoked per day?" is "About how many cigarettes have you smoked per day?" with the time frame "past month"; "Thinking back over the past month, did you have problems with tiredness?" is "Did you have problems with tiredness?", also with "past month"; "On average, over the school year, how many hours per week do you work in a paid or unpaid job?" is "How many hours per week do you work in a paid or unpaid job?" with "school year".
   - "In your lifetime", "at any time in your life", "looking back over your entire life" and "if ever" are the time frame "lifetime", and are left out: "Have you smoked more than 10 cigarettes in your lifetime?" is "Have you smoked more than 10 cigarettes?"; "How many times, if ever, have you tried to stop smoking?" is "How many times have you tried to stop smoking?"; both have "lifetime".
   - **"Ever", asked about the past, is the time frame "lifetime" too, but the word stays**, because the question reads wrong without it: "Have you ever smoked cigarettes?" and "Did you ever lack energy most of the time?" keep their words and have the time frame "lifetime". So does each item under a lead-in with "ever" ("Have you ever: a. been diagnosed with epilepsy?" is the Grid "Have you ever" over "been diagnosed with epilepsy?" with "lifetime"). "Ever" in a question about the present means "at times" and is no time frame: "Do you ever feel "just miserable" for no reason?" has none.
   - "Now" is left out, with no time frame: a question with none is about now. "How tall are you now?" is "How tall are you?"; "Are you ill now in any way?" is "Are you ill in any way?". "Currently" and "usually" stay in the words.
3. **Without words that add nothing to what is asked.** Leave out "please" wherever it is printed, and padding such as "In general,", "On average,", "Now,", "if any,", "if you wanted some,", "Please indicate", "Please tell us", "would you say that", "to the best of your knowledge", "each of the following", "the following statements": "In general, how often do you think that things between you and your partner are going well?" is "How often do you think that things between you and your partner are going well?"; "Please think about the time in your life when …" is "Think about the time in your life when …"; "Please include part-time work." is "Include part-time work.". Don't drop a word that changes what is asked, and don't add one that isn't printed.
4. **People named one way.** "He/she", "his or her" and "him/her" are "they", "their" and "them" ("lied to get what he/she wanted" is "lied to get what they wanted"). The respondent's twin children are "the twins", not "your twins". A blank or bracket printed for a person's name ("(name of twin 1)", "(CHILD'S NAME)") is written as who it stands for ("the twins", "your child"). Any other fill-in ("(SYMPTOM)", "(number in B.2a)", "(are/were)") stays as printed.
5. **Only the question.** No number or letter, no answer choices, no unit printed by an answer box, no routing, no direction on how to answer, no leader dots (". . .", "....", "…"). Join lines broken by the layout with single spaces, and rejoin words hyphenated across a line break. Also:
   - **No "If yes," or "If so," at the start of a follow-up.** Its `parent_question` says that: "If yes, which medications?" is "Which medications?"; "If yes, how many cigarettes did you typically smoke per day?" is "How many cigarettes did you typically smoke per day?".
   - **No meaning of a term.** Words that say what a term means ("that is, …", "(a drink is …)", "…, meaning …") come out of the question and become a **Definition** written "term = meaning": "How many close friends do you have, that is, people with whom you can share your most secret worries and hopes?" is the Definition "Friend = people with whom you can share your most secret worries and hopes" and the Question "How many close friends do you have?". When a Definition printed with the question already says what the term means, the words are only left out: "Have you ever had an alcoholic drink, that is, beer, wine, or liquor (vodka, whiskey, brandy, etc.)?" printed with "An alcoholic drink means a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine, or a shot of liquor." is "Have you ever had an alcoholic drink?".
   - **No list of examples printed after the question.** "How many times per week do you exercise vigorously for at least 20 minutes? (For example, running, tennis, vigorous swimming)" is "How many times per week do you exercise vigorously for at least 20 minutes?". Examples that are part of the sentence stay: "school activities (such as clubs, band, cheerleading)?", "smoking marijuana (pot, grass)?".
   - **No sentence or opening clause that says whom or what to count or leave out.** It becomes an **Instruction**, written as a plain order: "Not including your twin, how many close friends do you have?" and "There is no need to include your twin." are both the Instruction "Do not include your twin." (pattern 7). A short bracket inside the sentence stays in it: "did you tease or hurt animals (not including hunting)?", "what is the most you have weighed (not including pregnancy if you are female)?".
   - **Abbreviations written out, and quoted words in double quotes.** "30 mins." is "30 minutes", "yrs" is "years", "approx." is "approximately". Words printed in quotation marks keep them as double quotes, never single: "butt in", "on the go", "fed-up".
   - **How it ends.** A question ends with a question mark and a statement with a full stop. A stem that the answer choices or boxes finish has no punctuation at the end, whatever is printed: "My health is:" over "Excellent / Very good / …" is "My health is"; "When the pain in your muscles, joints, or bones was at its worst, it lasted:" over boxes for weeks and months is "When the pain in your muscles, joints, or bones was at its worst, it lasted"; "Compared to other people your age, do you think your physical health has been:" over "Much better / Better / …" is "Compared to other people your age, do you think your physical health has been".

A printed sentence the question's words point back to stays at the start of its `text`, because the question can't be understood without it: "Think about the time in your life when you were drinking the most. During this period, how often did you have an alcoholic drink?" is one Question with both sentences ("this period" is set by the first).

## Blocks

The questionnaire is a tree of blocks in printed order: a Section's, Grid's or Group's `children` are the blocks printed under it, nested inside it. Never list a Section, Grid or Group and then the blocks that belong to it after it. Each block's `component_type` is one of:

- **Section**: a part of the questionnaire under a printed heading, holding the blocks printed under it (its `children`). `text` is the heading, including any number or letter ("Part B. Your health"), without a time its questions are tagged with ("About your health in your lifetime" is "About your health", and each of its questions has the time frame "lifetime"). Sections sit inside sections: a numbered part ("Section four: About yourself and your family relationships") holds every headed sub-section printed in it ("About your personality", "About religion and other activities"), up to the next numbered part.
- **Grid**: several questions that share the start of their sentence (its `children`). `text` is that start (the lead-in), and each question under it has the words that finish it, so the lead-in and each item read as one complete sentence: "How frequently have the twins" over "skipped school", "How often do you drink alcohol" over "at a party with friends?" (see "Layouts", pattern 2). A Grid holds only its questions, with any Instruction or Definition that is about those questions alone: never a Section, Grid or Group. It can sit inside a Section or a Group.
- **Group**: sets apart some of a Section's blocks that belong together and have no heading of their own (its `children`): an Instruction or Definition with the questions it is about, when the Section's other questions aren't. It has no `text`: it is only a container. A Group can sit inside a Section or another Group; a Section never sits inside a Group or a Grid.
- **Question**: asks for one or more answers, and has the `variables` that record them.
- **Introduction**: opening text that tells the respondent what the questionnaire or study is about.
- **Instruction**: printed text that changes what the answers mean: what to count or leave out ("Do not include brothers or sisters.", "Include step and half brothers and sisters but not your twin."), which situation to answer for ("If you are separated or divorced, answer for the last time you were married or living with someone."), or who answers ("For females only.": see "Who answers"). Record only that part, as a plain order or statement in whole sentences, without "please" and without any direction on how to mark the answer printed with it ("Please fill the oval for either Yes or No to indicate whether there has ever been a period in your life, lasting two weeks or more, when you had the following." is "Indicate whether there has ever been a period in your life, lasting two weeks or more, when you had the following."). Text that only says how to answer, only announces what comes next, or only explains a table's columns is not an Instruction: it is left out. Words that become a Grid's lead-in or a tag aren't recorded again as an Instruction. An Instruction about everything in a Section goes first in the Section, before its Grids, not inside one of them.
- **Definition**: says what a term means. One printed as a sentence of its own keeps its words ("An alcoholic drink means a can or bottle of beer, a glass of wine, or a shot of liquor.", "One pack equals 20 cigarettes."); one taken out of a question is written "term = meaning" ("Friend = people with whom you can share your most secret worries and hopes"). A printed list of terms is one Definition for each term: "Tranquilizers = Valium, Xanax, Librium, Ativan, other anti-anxiety drugs", then "Sedatives = sleeping pills, downers, …".
- **Interviewer Script**: words an interviewer reads aloud, or directions for the interviewer.
- **Note**: any other printed text that tells a researcher something about the questions ("Families often differ on how decisions are made.").

Allowed types: {{component_types}}.

Only Questions have `printed_number`, `parent_question`, `time_frame` and `variables`, and only Sections, Grids and Groups have `children` (and `continued`, described under "Page ranges"). Every block except a Group has `text`.

## Layouts

Questionnaires mix layouts. Build each one from blocks like this.

1. **A numbered question with its own answer boxes** is one Question, placed where it is printed.
2. **A battery**: several items printed under one lead-in (lettered sub-items, such as "5. In the past month: a. … b. …", or the rows of a table whose columns are the answer choices). What it becomes depends on its items.
   - **Each item is a whole question or statement on its own, and the lead-in adds nothing to it** ("Are you a worrier?", "I felt shaky or jittery.", "My child is always a good listener."): each is its own Question, straight in its Section, with the battery's choices and its `printed_number` (the item's number and the sub-item's letter run together: "39a", "39b", … "39aa"). The lead-in is not a block: a lead-in that only says how to answer ("Please indicate how much you agree or disagree with each statement below.") is left out; a time it names is each question's `time_frame`; and only what changes what the answers mean is an Instruction before them (in a Group with them, unless they are all their Section holds).
   - **The items are only times, or only people**: this is **one Question** with the battery's number as its `printed_number` and one variable for each item, in order, with no `label`.
     - Times: "49. On how many occasions have you smoked cigarettes: a. in your lifetime? b. in the last 12 months? c. in the last 30 days?" is the Question "On how many occasions have you smoked cigarettes?", numbered "49", whose three variables have the time frames "lifetime", "past year" and "past month".
     - People: "12. How many: a. older brothers do you have? b. older sisters do you have?" is the Question "How many older brothers and sisters do you have?", numbered "12", whose two variables have the subjects "older brother" and "older sister". A list of people to mark is the same: "Which of the following people lived with you? Natural father / Natural mother / Stepfather (or male guardian) / Brother(s) and/or sister(s) / Other relatives / Non-relatives" is one Question, "Which of the following people lived with you?", with a variable for each person, each with the choices "yes" and "no" and the person as its `subject` ("father", "mother", "stepfather", "siblings", "other relatives", "non-relatives"), not as a `label`.
   - **Otherwise the items finish a sentence the lead-in starts**: the battery is a **Grid**. That includes a lead-in that holds part of the question the items don't have, such as how often, how much or how many: "How often:" over "a. Do you and your partner argue over money matters in front of the twins?" is the Grid "How often" over "do you and your partner argue over money matters in front of the twins?", not a list of yes-or-no questions.
     - The Grid's `text` is the lead-in, written as the start of the sentence each item finishes: without its number, without a time (that is each item's `time_frame`), without padding ("each of the following", "would you say that", "please indicate"), and without the question mark, colon, dash or dots it ends with.
     - Each item is a **Question** in the Grid, in printed order. Its `text` is the item's words, without its letter, written so that the lead-in and the item, read one after the other, make **one complete, grammatical sentence**. Change the form of the item's first word or two so that the sentence is grammatical ("How frequently have you" over "a. Did something that the twins enjoy" and "b. Ate dinner with the twins" is "done something that the twins enjoy" and "eaten dinner with the twins"; "Was suspended" becomes "been suspended"), and never repeat the lead-in's words in the item ("How old were you when you first" over "smoked a cigarette?", not over "smoked your first cigarette?"). Change nothing else: the item's other words stay as printed ("let the twins know that we like it when they help around the house" keeps its "we").
     - **Keep the printed split.** The words printed in the lead-in stay in the lead-in, and the words printed with the item stay in the item: don't move a word from one to the other. "Because of my physical health, I . . ." over "a. accomplished less than I wanted to." is "Because of my physical health, I" and "accomplished less than I wanted to."; "Of your friends, how many are:" over "a. younger boys?" is "Of your friends, how many are" and "younger boys?".
     - **Never drop what the lead-in says about its items.** A lead-in that says what the items are about, or under what condition, keeps those words: "As a result of using any of the types of drugs listed above (marijuana/hashish, hallucinogens, …), have you ever:" stays the Grid's lead-in, "As a result of using marijuana/hashish, hallucinogens, …, have you ever", and "Has the biological father of the twins used any of the following without a doctor telling him to take them?" over "a. Cigarettes" is "Without a doctor telling them to take them, has the biological father of the twins used" and "cigarettes?" (its clause moved to the front, so that each item finishes the sentence).
     - A lead-in that breaks off in mid-sentence ends with no punctuation ("Have you ever, for at least two weeks" over "felt depressed, blue, or down in the dumps most of the time?"). Only a lead-in that is a whole clause set before its questions ends with a comma (see the last example below).
     - Examples (lead-in, then an item):
       - "In the past month, how frequently would you say that you and/or your spouse (or partner) have done each of the following?" over "a. Sat around with the twins and talked as a family" is "How frequently have you and/or your spouse (or partner)" and "sat around with the twins and talked as a family", with the time frame "past month" on each item.
       - "In the past 4 weeks, how often . . ." over "a. have you felt calm and peaceful?" is "How often" and "have you felt calm and peaceful?", each item with "past four weeks".
       - "Please indicate how frequently, if ever, Twin A has done each of the following:" over "a. Was suspended or sent home from school for doing something wrong" is "How frequently have the twins" and "been suspended or sent home from school for doing something wrong" ("was" becomes "been" to fit; for "the twins", see "The same questions about each of several people").
       - "How important is it in your family to do each of the following?" over "Say grace or the blessing at mealtimes" is "How important is it in your family" and "to say grace or the blessing at mealtimes?".
       - A checklist of things: "Have you ever had any of the following conditions?" over "Diabetes", "Asthma" is "Have you ever had" and "diabetes?", "asthma?", each with the time frame "lifetime". A row that only names a group for the rows indented under it ("Diabetes" over "Onset before age 18" and "Onset after age 18") isn't a block of its own: each row under it carries the group's name ("diabetes with onset before age 18?"; "Pregnancy related problems" over "Nausea" is "pregnancy related nausea?"), unless the row's own words already say it ("Post-partum depression" under "Pregnancy related problems" is "post-partum depression?").
       - A lead-in that sets the situation its items ask about stays a lead-in, ending with a comma: "Thinking back to the time in your life when you were smoking the most:" over "a. How many cigarettes did you smoke per day?" is "Thinking back to the time in your life when you were smoking the most," and "how many cigarettes did you smoke per day?".
     - Each item's `printed_number` is the item's number and its letter run together ("16a", "16b"). Items printed with numbers of their own keep them ("28. Smoked cigarettes", "29. Used any amount of alcohol" are "28" and "29"). Items with neither a letter nor a number of their own each have the battery's number; rows grouped under a row that only names them are told apart by a figure after the letter ("49g1", "49g2").
     - Each item has one variable with the battery's choices and no `label`. When each item has several answer columns, it has one variable per column, in column order:
       - a column of a time ("in your lifetime", "in the last 12 months") has that `time_frame` and no `label`;
       - a column of a person ("Mother", "Father", "Yourself", "Your relatives") has that `subject` (none for the respondent) and no `label`;
       - a column that counts something ("Number of relatives affected") is a NUMBER with what it counts as its `unit` ("relatives") and no `label`;
       - a column of a kind ("Drinking", "Drug use", "Age started", "Being treated now") has it as its `label`.
     - **When some columns are about other people, the lead-in names them with the respondent**: a table of conditions with a column for "Yourself" and one for "Other relatives" is the Grid "Have you or any of your family members ever had" (printed "any immediate family member": "Have you or any immediate family member ever had"), each item with a variable for the respondent and one with the subject "family". The sentence that explains the columns is left out.
     - The items can have different kinds of answer (a number for one, Yes or No for the next).
     - A direction printed with the lead-in ("Please give an answer for "a" - "d".") is left out. Only what changes what the answers of these items alone mean is an Instruction, first inside the Grid.
     - A Grid is never left out because it holds everything in its Section: the lead-in is in nothing else.
3. **A table whose rows are blank slots for people or things** (first child, second child, …) and whose columns are separately headed questions about each one: each column is a Question whose `text` is the whole question its heading stands for, about one of the rows ("Sex" over a table of children is "What is your child's sex?"; over a table of brothers and sisters, "What is your sibling's sex?"), with one variable per row, in row order, with no `label` and no `subject`: the question's words say who it is about, and the rows are alike, told apart by their order and their MATR IDs. A column with more than one box per row (pounds and ounces) has one variable per box, in row order, each with its `unit`. If the columns carry their own printed numbers ("#1", "#2", …), each column's `printed_number` is the item number, "#" and the column number: column #3 of item 4 is "4#3". If they don't, every column's `printed_number` is the item number. This is not a Grid: each column is a whole question.
4. **A question whose answer blanks finish its sentence** ("How old were you when these symptoms started? ___ these symptoms stopped? ___") is a Grid: its `text` is the words before the first blank ("How old were you when"), and each blank is a Question with the words printed with it ("these symptoms started?", "these symptoms stopped?").
5. **A definition printed inside or beside a question** comes out of the question's text (see "Wording", 5). Put the Definition and the Question together in a Group, Definition first, unless they are all their Section holds.
6. **A numbered question followed by an unnumbered part** that asks something more ("If yes, list them below.") is two Questions, one after the other. The first has the printed number ("12"); the second has none, unless a number or letter is printed beside it, and is written as a whole question without its "If yes," ("Which ones?"). The second hangs off the first (its `parent_question`: see "Questions"), which is what links them, so they need no Group.
7. **A sentence or clause printed with a question that says what to count or include** in the answer ("Please include delivering newspapers, cutting the grass, baby-sitting, etc.", "Do not count the times you were sick.", "Not including your twin, …"), or which situation to answer for, never goes in the question's `text`: it is an **Instruction** before the question, and the two go together in a **Group**, the Instruction first, unless they are all their Section holds. "On average, over the school year, how many hours per week do you work in a paid or unpaid job? Please include delivering newspapers, cutting the grass, baby-sitting, etc." is a Group holding the Instruction "Include delivering newspapers, cutting the grass, baby-sitting, etc." and then the Question "How many hours per week do you work in a paid or unpaid job?" with the time frame "school year". An Instruction about several questions goes first in one Group with all of them, or first in their Section when they are all it holds. A question with both a Definition and an Instruction has the Definition first, then the Instruction, then the Question.
8. **A printed heading over several items** is a Section with that heading, holding everything printed under it up to the next heading of the same rank. Sections sit inside sections. A Grid always stays a Grid inside the Section.

### When to use a Group

A Group sets some blocks apart from the other blocks of their Section (or of the top level): an Instruction or Definition with the questions it is about, when the Section's other questions aren't. With directions on how to answer left out, most questions need none. Don't make one:

- just because questions share a printed number (5a, 5b, 5c), or are a numbered item's sub-items: they are Questions straight in the Section;
- when it would hold everything in its Section: the Section already holds them, so they go straight in it (the Instruction first);
- around a single block;
- around a question and its follow-up: `parent_question` links them (pattern 6);
- around a battery whose items finish its lead-in's sentence: that is a Grid (pattern 2).

## Questions

- `text`: what is asked, written as "Wording" says: one complete question or statement (a Grid's item is the words that finish its Grid's lead-in), without the time and the padding, in the registry's plain words.
- `printed_number`: the number or label printed beside the question, as text, exactly as printed but without its trailing period or bracket: "7", "12b", "4.3", "Q7". A sub-item's printed letter is run together with its item's number ("5a"); for a Grid's items and a battery recorded as one Question, see pattern 2. Leave it out when no number or letter is printed for the question: never make one up. A letter that is printed but covered by a mark or handwriting is the one its place in the run gives: between "b" and "f" come "c", "d" and "e". Printed numbers can repeat (each section can start again at 1): never change one to make it unique.
- `parent_question`: the `printed_number` of the earlier question this one only makes sense after, if any.
  - A question hangs off an earlier one when its words, **or its Grid's lead-in**, can't be understood without it, because they point back to what it asked about: a follow-up ("When did you start?" after "Do you smoke?"; "Which medications?" after "Have you ever taken any medications regularly?"), or words such as "these symptoms", "these feelings", "this period", "at such times", "the pain … at its worst", "when you had abdominal discomfort or pain", printed after the question that asked whether the respondent ever had them.
  - **The parent is the one question that asked whether it happened at all** (or that set "this period"), and every later question about that thing names that same question, not the one printed just before it. After "40. Have you ever had a time when you were feeling depressed, down, or sad most of the time for at least two weeks?", the items of "41. Think about the time when these feelings were at their worst: a. Did you lose interest …", then "42. How many separate times have you experienced these symptoms …", "43. When your feeling depressed, down, or sad was at its worst, it lasted" and "44. … how old were you when these symptoms started?" all have the parent "40".
  - **Every item of a Grid names the parent** when the Grid's lead-in points back: each item under "During this period when you were drinking the most, how many times" has as its parent the question that set "this period" ("46. Think about the time in your life when you were drinking the most. …").
  - **A question that can be understood on its own has no parent**, even if only some respondents are asked it, and even when routing sends the others past it. "Did you ever have pain in your shoulders, arms, or hands for 2 weeks or more?" printed after "Did you ever have pain in your muscles, joints, or bones that lasted for 2 weeks or more?" stands on its own. So does a question or lead-in that describes its own situation in full: "Thinking back to the time in your life when you were smoking the most, how soon after you woke up did you smoke your first cigarette?", "At the time in your life when you were drinking the most, how often did you have an alcoholic drink?" and "How many cigarettes would you typically smoke per day when smoking most heavily?" have no parent, though only people who smoked or drank answer them.
  - When the thing was asked about by a battery of several questions rather than by one ("Did you ever lack energy most of the time?", "Were you ever extremely tired most of the time?", …), there is no one question to hang off: the questions after it have no parent.
  - A question never hangs off the last item of the battery or Section before it just because it comes next.
  - When several earlier questions are printed with that number, the nearest one before it is meant.
- `time_frame`: the time all of the question's answers are about: see `time_frame` under "Tags".

### Who answers

Words printed on the page saying who should answer ("For females only", "Women only", "FOR TWINS", "COMPLETE THIS SECTION IF: ITEM H.4 IS BOX 3 OR GREATER") are an **Instruction** block, its words as printed (without brackets, ending with a full stop), placed before the question they are about, or first in the Section, Grid or Group they are printed over. They never go in a question's `text`, and they are not a field of the question. "If yes" printed with a follow-up isn't one: it is what `parent_question` records, and it is left out.

## Tags

A tag says when an answer is about (`time_frame`), which person it is about when one question is answered about several (`subject`), or what a written-in number counts (`unit`). The words a time frame stands for are left out of the question's `text`, so "Have you smoked?" about a lifetime and about the last four months are one question with two tags. Each tag is written once.

- `time_frame`: when the answers are about, when the question, its Grid's lead-in, its Section's heading or the box's column or row names a time.
  - It goes on the **Question** when it is about all of its answers ("Have you smoked more than 10 cigarettes?" has "lifetime"; a Grid's lead-in "In the past month, …" gives each of its questions "past month"), and on a **variable** only when the question's variables are about different times (one for "lifetime", one for "past year"). A Question with a `time_frame` has no variable with one.
  - Use the one of these that means the same: {{time_frames}}. For any other, write it the same way: "lifetime"; "past" and the number of days, weeks, months or years, the number in words up to nine and in figures from ten ("past two weeks", "past six months", "past 14 days"); "since age 18", "before age 12"; "childhood"; "school year".
  - **A year and a month are each one tag, whatever the form calls them**: "in the last 12 months", "over the past twelve months" and "in the past year" are all "past year"; "in the last 30 days", "over the last month" and "in the past month" are all "past month". Never write "past 12 months" or "past 30 days".
  - **"Ever" asked about the past, and "if ever", are "lifetime"** ("Have you ever …", "Did you ever …", "Were you ever …", "How many of your friends have ever …", "Have the twins ever …"), as are "in your lifetime", "in your life" and "at any time in your life". "Do you ever …" asks about the present and has no time frame.
  - Leave it out when no time is named: "now", "currently" and "usually" aren't time frames.
- `subject`, **a variable's field, never a Question's**: which person this variable's answer is about. It is recorded **only when the same question is answered about more than one person**, so that their answers have to be told apart:
  - a column or box for each of several people in one question ("Mother" and "Father"; "Yourself" and "Your relatives"; "Older brothers" and "Older sisters"): each variable about someone other than the respondent has that person as its `subject`, and the respondent's own variable has none;
  - the same questions printed once about one person and again about another (a section about Twin A, then the same section about Twin B): see "The same questions about each of several people".
  - **A question that is about one person or one group has no `subject`**: its words already say who. "What is your child's sex?", "Do the twins share the same room?", "Has the biological father of the twins used cigarettes?", "Did your parents or guardians argue with each other?", "Family members really help one another.", "Do you have more than five children?", "Which twin got blamed most for things by their dad?" and every question about the respondent have none. Most questions have none.
  - It is the person's relation to the respondent, in lower case and as short as it can be: "mother", "father", "stepfather", "stepmother", "spouse/partner", "siblings", "older brother", "older sister", "twin a", "twin b". Printed alternatives and qualifiers are dropped: "Natural father" is "father", "Stepfather (or male guardian)" is "stepfather", "Brother(s) and/or sister(s)" is "siblings". The respondent's relatives in general ("Your relatives", "Other relatives", "Family members", "Any immediate family member") are "family"; "other relatives" and "non-relatives" are used only for those entries of a list of people that also names closer relatives. Use one of these when it means the same: {{subjects}}; for any other, write it the same way.
- `unit`, open-ended variables whose answer is a number: what the number counts or is measured in, as one plain noun in the plural: "years", "months", "weeks", "days", "hours", "times", "cigarettes", "drinks", "relatives", "pounds", "ounces", "feet", "inches".
  - Take it from the words printed by the box, abbreviations written out ("yrs." is "years", "lbs" is "pounds"); when none are printed, from what the question or the column's heading asks for: "How many cigarettes …" is "cigarettes", "How many times …" is "times", "How old were you when …" and "Age started" are "years", "How many years of schooling …" is "years", "Number of relatives affected" is "relatives".
  - **Never a rate.** "Per day", "per week" and "a day" belong to the question's words: a box captioned "cigarettes per day" under "How many cigarettes would you typically smoke per day?" has the unit "cigarettes"; "How many times per week do you exercise?" has "times".
  - Use one of these when it means the same: {{units}}. Leave it out for words, for a date, and for a number that counts or measures nothing (a year, a school grade).

## The same questions about each of several people

Some questionnaires print the same questions once about one person and again about another: a section about Twin A, then the same section about Twin B. They are the same questions. The site joins each pair into one question with a variable for each person, **but only when the two are recorded in exactly the same words**, and the two sections are read in separate requests that can't see each other's answer. So word them by rule, the same way every time:

- **Replace the person's name with the people together, and change nothing else** but the verb that has to agree with it: "Twin A" and "Twin B" are "the twins", "Twin A's" is "the twins'", "Has Twin A ever" is "Have the twins ever", "Does Twin B" is "Do the twins", and "he/she" is "they". Every other word stays as printed, in the singular or plural it is printed in: "What is the sex of Twin A?" is "What is the sex of the twins?"; "the first five years of Twin B's life" is "the first five years of the twins' life" (never "lives"); "his or her physical development" is "their physical development".
- Word the Grid's lead-in, the Section's heading and the choices the same way: "Please indicate how frequently Twin A does each of the following" is "How frequently do the twins"; "About Twin A's interactions with others" is "About the twins' interactions with others"; the choice "Describes Twin A very well" is "describes them very well". A statement about "my child" keeps its words ("My child is always a good listener.").
- Each of these questions' variables has the one person as its `subject`: "twin a" in Twin A's section, "twin b" in Twin B's.
- Record each where it is printed, the second time too, with its own printed number.

Inside one question or table, a column or box for each person ("Mother", "Father") is one Question with a variable for each (pattern 2).

## Variables

A question has one variable for each separate answer a respondent can record, that is, each column the answers would fill in a spreadsheet, in printed order. A question with a blank for weeks, a blank for months and a box for "All of my life" has three variables. A box or several ruled lines for writing one answer in words (a list, an explanation) is one variable, however many lines it has.

- `variable_type`: "closed_ended" when the respondent marks one of the printed choices (boxes, bubbles, ovals, numbers to circle); "open_ended" when they write the answer (a line, a blank, boxes for digits).
- `label`: what this variable records, **only when the question's words and the tags don't say it**: the words of a check-all-that-apply box ("City", "Farm"), the request of a write-in that goes with a choice ("Please describe"), a column of a kind ("Drinking", "Drug use", "Being treated now"), a caption that says more than its unit ("Age started", with the unit "years"). Most variables have none: leave it out for a question's only variable, for a variable its `subject`, `time_frame` or `unit` already describes (a column headed "Mother" whose subject is "mother"; "In the last 12 months" whose time frame is "past year"; "Number of relatives affected" whose unit is "relatives"; a box captioned "Cigarettes per day" whose unit is "cigarettes"; "Yourself" for the respondent), for a person in a list of people (pattern 2), for the rows of a table of blank slots (pattern 3), and for a check box whose one choice already says what it records (see "A lone check box"). A label never repeats a tag. When there is one, it is the caption's words, with abbreviations written out, and without words saying who fills it in ("If yes,", "If so,").
- `subject`, `time_frame`, `unit`: see "Tags".
- `answer_data_type`, open-ended variables only: "NUMBER" for counts, ages, years, amounts and other numbers; "TEXT" for words; "DATE" for a date or part of one; "TIME" for a time of day. Allowed: {{answer_data_types}}.
- `response_options`, closed-ended variables only: the choices printed on the form, in printed order. A respondent can only mark a choice that is printed, so never add one that isn't (such as a "No" for a lone box left empty), except the "No" of each box of a check-all-that-apply list. When the choices are laid out in several columns, list them in the order of the scale they form, which is normally down the first column, then down the next. When a battery or table prints its choices once as column headings, every question repeats them.

## Choices (`response_options`)

- `answer_option`: the choice in the registry's standard wording, which is all the database keeps of it (not how it was printed): all in lower case, abbreviations written out ("DK" is "don't know"; "M" and "F" printed for a sex are "male" and "female", but a letter that is the answer itself stays a letter: a school grade "F" is "f"), no routing, no question mark, and no full stop or colon at the end, and about "them" rather than a named person ("Describes Twin A very well" is "describes them very well"). When one of these registry wordings says the same as the printed choice, use it exactly as listed, square brackets and all (the registry writes what qualifies an answer in brackets after it: "yes [most of the time]", "once [a week]", "a few times [a month]"). Never use one that says more or less than the printed choice: a printed "Yes" is "yes", even when the list has "yes [not only after the death of a loved one]".
{{answer_options}}
- **A choice that asks for more** ("Yes, please describe:", "Other (specify)"): the choice's `answer_option` is the answer alone ("yes", "other"), and the question gets one more variable right after it for what is written: open-ended, `answer_data_type` "TEXT", labelled with the request, without its colon ("Please describe", "Other (specify)").
- **A lone check box.** When a question or a table column offers a single box to mark, its variable has one choice. Don't add a "No" for the box left empty: it isn't printed.
  - A box printed with words of its own beside it ("All of my life.", "these symptoms haven't stopped"): the choice is those words, in lower case and without the full stop, as its `answer_option` (never "yes"), and the variable has no `label`, since the choice says what it records.
  - A box with no words of its own (a bubble under a column heading such as "Yourself", or in a table of children): the choice is "yes", and the column heading is the variable's `subject` when it names a person other than the respondent, otherwise its `label` (none for "Yourself").
- **A check-all-that-apply list** ("Mark all that apply", "Check each one") is different: one variable per box, each with the two choices "yes" and "no" (marked or not), labelled with the words printed beside it, or, when the boxes are people, with the person as its `subject` and no label (pattern 2). The direction itself isn't recorded.

## Routing

Routing tells some respondents to jump ahead: "(Go to Question 9)", "If no, skip to Section C", "If none, go to Question 57", "You have finished". The database doesn't keep where respondents are sent, so routing is not recorded: leave it out of every `text` and every `answer_option` ("No (Go to Question 9)" is the choice "no"), and never make a block of it (not an Instruction, Note or Interviewer Script). What routing says about who answers the questions after it ("If you are not a twin, go to Question 52" means the next questions are for twins) is recorded as an Instruction saying who answers ("For twins only."), as under "Who answers". A question that only makes sense after an earlier one names it as `parent_question` whether or not routing links them.

## The questionnaire

`questionnaire.name` and `questionnaire.abbreviation` are the title and abbreviation printed on the form. Leave them out when they aren't printed (or are covered).

## Page ranges

A questionnaire is read a few pages at a time, each range in a request of its own, so the end of this prompt names the pages to record ("This PDF has 6 pages. Record pages 3-4."). The whole PDF is there so you can see what comes before and after, but **record only the blocks that are printed on your pages**:

- A question that starts on your last page and runs onto the next is yours, in full. One that started before your first page isn't, and neither is any item of a battery that is printed on the page before yours: when a battery carries on from the page before, start with the first item printed on your page. Another request records the other pages, so anything you record from them is recorded twice.
- If your pages hold nothing to record (a cover, a blank page), or the PDF has no such pages, answer with an empty `components` list. Never record another page's blocks in their place.
- Give questions their printed numbers, and name parents by their printed numbers even when they're on other pages.

If your first page carries on a Section, Grid or Group that began on an earlier page (more items of the same battery, table or headed section), start with it again, with `continued: true` (and, for a Section, its heading as `text`; for a Grid, its lead-in as `text`, each worded exactly as these rules word it, so that it matches what the pages before recorded), holding only the blocks on your pages. Do the same for every Section, Grid or Group inside it that also carries on: look back through the earlier pages for the numbered part and the headed sub-section your first blocks are printed in. A headed sub-section that starts on your pages inside a part that began earlier ("About your personality" inside "Section four: …") goes inside that part, started again with `continued: true`. Leave `continued` out everywhere else. A time named by a heading or lead-in on an earlier page still tags your questions under it.

```

Everything under the heading is inside its Section. 4 is a Grid: its lead-in sets the situation both items ask about, so its `text` is "On a typical day," and each item finishes the sentence ("On a typical day, how many cups of coffee do you drink?"); 4b's "it" is written out, so the sentence stands. 4a and 4b hang off 3: they only make sense for someone who drinks coffee, so each item names "3" as its `parent_question`. 5 is a direction that is itself the question, written as the question, and a check-all-that-apply list: a variable per box, labelled with the box's words, each with "yes" and "no". 6 is a Grid whose lead-in names a time: the time is each item's `time_frame`, not words, so the lead-in is "I have" and each item finishes it ("I have walked to work."). The line before 7 only says how to answer, so it isn't recorded, and 7a and 7b, whole questions on their own, are Questions straight in the Section; 7b loses its padding ("In general,"). 8 is a label, written as the question it stands for, with a variable for each unit and no labels. 9's items are only times, so it is one Question with a variable for each time, numbered "9", with no labels; each counts times, so that is its `unit`. In 10 the time is about the whole question, so it is the question's `time_frame` ("the last 12 months" is "past year"), while the two variables are about different people, so each has its own `subject`; the direction in brackets isn't recorded. No other variable has a `subject`: every other question is about one person, whom its words name. 11 asks "ever", so it keeps the word and has the time frame "lifetime"; its unnumbered second part is a Question of its own, without "If yes," and with "11" as its parent. 12's opening clause says whom to leave out, so it is an Instruction, written as a plain order; "that is, …" says what a term means, so it is a Definition, written "term = meaning"; the question keeps neither, and the three go in a Group, since the Section's other questions aren't about close friends. 13 is a stem its choices finish, so it has no punctuation at the end. The routing printed beside "No" ("Go to Question 5") isn't recorded: the choice is "no".

## Before you answer

Check:

- **Pages.** That you went through every one of your pages to the end; that every block you recorded is printed on your pages, none from the page before or after, and none twice.
- **Wording.** That every Question's `text` is one complete question or statement in plain words, or finishes its Grid's lead-in so that the two read as one grammatical sentence; that no `text` holds a time that should be a `time_frame`, "now", "please", padding ("in general,", "on average,", "if any,", "please indicate", "each of the following"), "he/she" or "his or her", "If yes,", a direction on how to answer, a pointer to another question or page, a meaning of a term, examples printed after the question, a number, a unit or leader dots; that no label was left as a question ("Height?"); and that a stem the choices finish has no punctuation at the end.
- **Structure.** That every Section has its printed heading and holds the blocks printed under it, sub-sections inside their numbered part; that every battery whose items finish its lead-in's sentence is a Grid, and every battery of whole questions or statements is Questions straight in its Section; that a battery or list whose items are only times or only people is one Question with a variable for each; that no Grid holds a Section, Grid or Group; that no direction on how to answer, no announcement and no explanation of a table's columns was recorded as an Instruction, and every Instruction changes what an answer means; that every Group sets an Instruction or Definition and its questions apart from others in the same Section (none holds its whole Section, and none is there only because its questions share a number).
- **Tags.** That every question that asks "ever" or "in your lifetime" has the time frame "lifetime", every "last 12 months" is "past year" and every "last 30 days" is "past month"; that every `time_frame` is written once, on the Question when it is about all of it and on a variable only when the variables are about different times; that no Question has a `subject`, and no variable has one unless its question is answered about more than one person; that every variable whose answer is a number has the `unit` it counts, as a plain plural noun and never a rate ("cigarettes", not "cigarettes per day"); that no `label` repeats a tag, and no variable has a label it doesn't need.
- **Several people.** That questions asked about each of several people are worded alike, with only the name replaced ("the twins") and its verb changed, each variable with its one person as `subject`.
- **Parents.** That every follow-up, and every item of a Grid whose lead-in points back ("these symptoms", "this period", "at its worst"), names as its `parent_question` the earlier question that asked whether the thing happened; and that every parent is a question printed earlier.
- **Answers.** That every question has at least one variable, every closed-ended variable at least one choice and no choice that isn't printed (but a check-all box's "No"); that no printed number was made up; that no routing was recorded anywhere; that words saying who answers are an Instruction; that no lone check box with words of its own was recorded as "yes"; that every check-all-that-apply box has "yes" and "no"; and that every `answer_option` is in lower case.
